<!-- KimaiTrack is the time tracking solution running in your menu bar.

Check your running time and quickly start and stop your timer directly from your menu bar. Switch to other projects without hassle with just another click on one of your recent activities. KimaiBar detects when you are idle for a certain time and asks you, what to do with the time when you come back. -->
